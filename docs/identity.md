## Logo Elements

The City of Oakland is identified by a combination of the green bar, the iconic oak tree and the City of Oakland wordmark.

## The Tree

The Oakland oak tree symbol is beloved and benefits from excellent recognition. As part of this exercise, the tree was redrawn to improve its legibility and technical reproduction potential, while maintaining its character and authenticity.

## Logo Construction and Proportions

Using the simple markers of the tree height and trunk width, a set of proportions was created to guide ideal spacing of elements.The tree height unit is used to define a set proportion of three thirds, where the middle one and the other two are the margins.

The trunk width is used as one half of the horizontal spacing between elements.

## Logo Minimum Size

To ensure legibility, never size the logo smaller than these widths.

## Logo Colors

The preferred treatment is the two-color version in either white or black (depending on the context).

When design or production constraints limit the colors available, a one-color version can be used, in either black, white or green.

## Logo Translation

Given the diversity of Oakland’s population, our logos have been crafted to work in many of the languages our community speaks.

## Identity System

Signatures have been created for all key city departments. They come in two layout versions, for bottom or top anchoring. The Bottom-anchoring marks should be used as the default.

## Vertical Responsiveness

Depending on the needs and space available, the signature system can adapt from its ideal state to a more horizontally compact state, as long as the tree height bottom margin is maintained.

## Logo Anchoring

Oakland is where so many families and communities have put down roots. We use the logo and its green vertical rule to anchor layout elements, placing them either at the top or bottom of each piece or containing shape.

## Logo Don'ts

The logo has been crafted with care and with the various constraints of its use in mind. Consistency in how we project ourselves is key in building trust with our community.

Always use provided artwork, and reach out to Communications with any question on its usage that’s not covered here.
