## Logo Elements

The City of Oakland is identified by a combination of the green bar, the iconic oak tree and the City of Oakland wordmark.

## Construction and Proportions

The preferred treatment is the two-color version in either white or black (depending on the context).

When design or production constraints limit the colors available, a one-color version can be used, in either black, white or green.

## Logo Translation

Given the diversity of Oaklandâ€™s population, our logos have been crafted to work in many of the languages our community speaks.

## Logo Anchoring

Oakland is where so many families and communities have put down roots. We use the logo and its green vertical rule to anchor layout elements, placing them either at the top or bottom of each piece or containing shape.

## Vertical Responsiveness

Depending on the needs and space available, the signature system can adapt from its ideal state to a more horizontally compact state, as long as the tree height bottom margin is maintained.
