## Fakt

Highly functional, Fakt is the typeface of the City of Oaklandâ€™s visual identity. It is a full family designed by Thomas Thiemich in 2010.

Clear, efficient and sensible, it aspires to communication that is engaging but to the point, and lets the content shine, all while providing the required gravitas of official communication.
